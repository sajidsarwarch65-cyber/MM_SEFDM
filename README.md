# MM_SEFDM
The code provides a Transformer-based decoder for multi-mode spectrally efficient frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (MM-SEFDM).
Transformer_based_MM_SEFDM_GitHub (1): Contains the complete code for training and testing the proposed Transformer-based MM-SEFDM model.
MM_SEFDM_GitHub: Folder containing the pretrained model weights.
Test_MM_SEFDM_Transformer: Script for directly testing the pretrained model from the MM_SEFDM_GitHub folder. The model can be evaluated for N=4, M=2, and compression factors ùõº = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0.
